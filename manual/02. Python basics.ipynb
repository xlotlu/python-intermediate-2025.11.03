    "* explain assumptions\n",
    "* explain important decisions\n",
    "* explain important details\n",
    "* explain problems you're trying to solve\n",
    "* explain problems you're trying to overcome in your program, etc.\n",
    "* temporarily disable a part of the program\n",

    "Every statement we write in a computer program is an instruction / command for the computer to execute. When the computer cannot do that, it will _throw an error_. These errors can happen for various reasons, such as syntactical mistakes, logical errors, or unexpected situations during runtime. When an error is thrown, the program stops completely. \n",
